Quiz App Using HTML, CSS &amp; JS

I have developed a quiz app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a primary focus on front-end design. The CSS has been skillfully implemented to ensure a visually appealing interface. While the back-end is not connected, the core logical operations are handled in JavaScript, enabling smooth functionality and interactive features within the app.
